We'll be covering Classical Machine Learning, Transformers, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a recent project you've worked on, and your past organizational experience. Feel free to ask me to repeat a question, or just let me know if you don't know the answer. Are you ready to begin with Classical Machine Learning?"

    "text": "เลย"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "gemini",
    "text": "Great. Let's start with Classical Machine Learning. Can you explain the bias-variance tradeoff and its importance in model selection?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "variant state of basically where we try to prevent the model from overfitting or underfitting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "gemini",
    "text": "Okay, that's a good start. Can you elaborate on how you would actually evaluate whether a model is suffering from high bias or high variance in a practical scenario?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "Okay so when the module is performing very well on the training data like if the train test the accuracy is very low compared to the train accuracy then we can say that the model is over fitting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "gemini",
    "text": "That's a good explanation. What are some specific techniques you might use to address high bias in a model?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "But if the model has trained accuracy low as well as this accuracy lower than it is under fitting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "gemini",

  {
    "speaker": "gemini",
    "text": "Regularization is typically used to address high variance, not high bias. Can you suggest other methods to handle high bias?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "yes we can use linear regression"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "gemini",
    "text": "While linear regression is a model, it doesn't inherently address high bias. High bias often means the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. What adjustments or different modeling approaches might you consider to reduce bias?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "we can use a simpler model if the data set is we can use a very complex model if the data is complex."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "gemini",
    "text": "That's correct. Using a more complex model is a good approach. Can you give me an example of a model that is more complex than linear regression and might be suitable for reducing bias?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "like this is generally"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "gemini",
    "text": "Decision trees are a good example. How does increasing the depth of a decision tree affect bias and variance?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "if we increase the depth the variance increases."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "gemini",
    "text": "That's right. As you increase the depth, the variance tends to increase. Now, let's switch gears. Can you briefly explain what a Transformer model is and what is the main innovation that Transformers brought to the field of deep learning?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "So basically tells us how much importance you need to give to each and every token and an input sequence. So for that we will use the query key and the value madresses."

  },

    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "So retrival augmented generation contains the retrieve and the generator."

    "speaker": "gemini",
    "text": "Can you tell me more about the roles and function of a \"retriever\" and a \"generator\" in a RAG framework?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "user",
    "text": "So that it reverted the context which are most relevant to a query and then sends it to the generative which along with the context passes on the query as well and generates things before its just abruptly I don't know."
